    stepByStep:
      "Remove the cauliflower's tough stem and reserve for another use. Using a food processor, pulse cauliflower florets until they resemble rice or couscous. You should end up with around four cups of \"cauliflower rice.\" \nHeat 1T butter and 1T oil in a large skillet over medium heat. \nAdd garlic and the white and light green pieces of scallion. Sauté about a minute. \nAdd the cauliflower to the pan. Stir to coat with oil, then spread out in pan and let sit; you want it cook a bit and to caramelize (get a bit brown), which will bring out the sweetness. After a couple of minutes, stir and spread out again. \nAdd cold rice (it separates easily, so it won't clump up during cooking), plus the additional grapeseed and coconut oil or butter. Raise heat to medium-high. Toss everything together and, again, spread the mixture out over the whole pan and press a bit into the bottom. \nLet it sit for about two minutes—so the rice can get toasted and a little crispy. \nAdd the peas and broccoli and stir again. \nDrizzle soy sauce and toasted sesame oil over rice.Cook for another minute or so and turn off heat. \nAdd chopped scallion tops and toss.I like to toast some sesame seeds in a dry pan; I sprinkle these and some more raw, chopped scallion over the top of the rice for added flavor and crunch.Season to taste with salt and, if you'd like, more soy sauce. Keep in mind that if you're serving this with something salty and saucy (ie. teriyaki chicken) you may want to hold off on adding too much salt to the fried rice.",

If you want to slice the pork (like for sandwiches) it is best to do when the pork is cold. \nLet the pork rest in the refrigerator for several hours or over night.

I usually give it a couple of swishes in the water and then remove. It may feel slightly stiff but by the time you are ready to roll up, the wrapper will become very pliable.

    stepByStep:
      "Chop off the stems of the swiss chard at the point where it meets the leaf. You could stem the swiss chard entirely. I like leaving a bit of stem with the leaves to give better structure to the wraps. \nChop the cauliflower into small pieces and pulse them in a food processor until it looks like rice. I usually pulse the cauliflower florets and the stalk together. \nPlace the olive oil in a saut pan over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the garlic and let it fry for about a minute or two, or until the garlic starts to brown. \nAdd the pulsed cauliflower rice and cook it for about 2-3 minutes. The cauliflower should turn into a vibrant yellow-orange color when it is cooked. \nAdd a pinch of salt and chopped basil to the cauliflower and stir. \nSpiralize the zucchini with Blade B to create zucchini noodles. If you do not have a spiralizer, just create zucchini ribbons with a vegetable peeler. \nTo assemble the wraps, place a large leaf flat down. \nAdd a bit of sauted cauliflower, zucchini noodles, red pepper, and avocado along the swiss chard stalk. \nDrizzle a bit of vinaigrette on top of the vegetables and wrap everything up. \nEnjoy these wraps as a side to your favorite protein! Feel free to dip these wraps in more sauce. \nThese wraps are best consumed when they are freshly made. Refrigerate any leftovers in an airtight container.",

    stepByStep:
      "Chop your onions, slice your carrots and smash your garlic. Set aside. \nPeel and chop the potatoes. Set aside in a bowl of cold water. \nRemove the casing from your chorizo. This is an important step. Chorizo casing is tough and unforgiving and will make the sausage link curl during the cooking process. Just remove it and don't worry about appearance. \nCut the links length-wise then chop into half-moons. \nSautee in a separate pan until the are nice and browned. Don't put into the pot until the last minute, otherwise the color of the chorizo will leach into the soup turning it a weird red color. \nNow it's time to prepare the kale. With each individual leaf, cut out the stem. You can do this several ways. \nCut a triangle out of the leaf, or fold over the leaf and cut out the stem that way. Or rip off the halves of the leaves off the stem. I like a little bit of stem to give some crunch and texture. \nTightly roll the leaf into a bundle. \nRun your knife over it to julienne the leaf into thin strips. \nDon't worry if it's not perfect. Set aside the kale. \nIn a big pot, sautee your onions, carrots and garlic in a bit of olive oil. \nOnce the vegetables start to soften, add the potatoes and some crushed red pepper flakes. Stir the pot and cook the potatoes until the outer edges start turning clear. \nThen add the 6 cups of water and 2 bouillion packets (or 4 cups of broth and 2 cups of water) to the pot. Bring to a boil then let simmer until the potatoes are cooked. \nWith a wooden spoon, mash the potatoes against the side of the pot. Do this until almost all the chunks of potatoes are mashed. Leave some chunks behind. This will give your soup a wonderful hearty texture. \nNow it's time to add the Kale. It looks like a lot and will fill up your whole pot but not to worry because it wilts down pretty quickly. \nCook for 5 minutes at a simmer then stir in chorizo sausage. \nServe hot or at room temperature (the latter is my favorite). Eat with a nice crusty loaf of Portuguese bread. Enjoy!",

They are now ready to go out of their jackets.Meanwhile, the broccoli  can be swimming for 6 minutes in the boiling water. Note: The water will cool off and when back to a boil, then add 5 minutes. Get them dry and cool under cold water, then they stay nice and green.The pepper may be under the grill until it sees black. \nLet them cool and peel them.Chop the parsley. \nPut the cooled broccoli in a long narrow bowl and blend finely with a hand blender. \nAdd the oil and vinegar with the salt. \nAdd half the parsley and mix into a smooth puree. If too grainy (dry) put some extra oil. \nCut the unseeded, peeled tomatoes and peppers into very small pieces.The shallot or onion may be chopped in mini pieces. \nAdd the chopped vegetables to the puree and stir gently with a spoon. The rest of the chopped parsley may be added now. A little salt, soy sauce and chili powder. Start with a little bit and add some more later if desired. The herbs de Provence can now embellish the whole with its bright flavor.The seaweed may now well out of the water and squeeze out any excess moisture. \nCut the seaweed finely and mix carefully with the puree.With an ice cream spoon you  create beautiful balls and sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds.bon apptit",

It is important to get the oil nice and hot (not smoking, just before that point) your shrimp should sizzle when added to the pan. Check the back of the shrimp and when you see the colour change about half way up, turn them over. Do the same on the other side. This should only take a minute to two minutes maximum on both sides  otherwise you will get a rubbery result if you leave it too long. Squeeze over the lime juice  this too should bubble and reduce. \nAdd a little salt and pepper, stir through, remove from the heat and set aside. \nMix the dressing ingredients together, check for flavour, adjust if need be and set aside. \nPlace all the salad ingredients in a bowl except the avocado and the salt and pepper. Prepare the avocado as you are about to serve otherwise it will turn brown. Once it is covered in the lime dressing, this will slow down the oxidization process and it wont go brown so easily. \nWhen you are ready to serve mix  of the avocado through the salad and add the dressing. Toss everything together. Taste to see if you need any salt and pepper. \nPlace your shrimp on top of the salad with the rest of the avocado and sprinkle/pour any residue from the pan over your salad in which you cooked the shrimp.

Cover and set aside while you prepare the rest of the food.Now prepare the sauce. \nWhisk together all of the ingredients and set aside.For the filling, combine the carrot, radish, green onions, green chilies and snow peas. \nPut the herbs in another bowl and have your sprouts ready along with the mushrooms. \nHeat a teaspoon of oil over medium heat in a non-stick skillet. When hot, ladle 1/2 cup of batter into the pan and spread with the bottom of the ladle until you have a roughly 6 to 8 inch pancake.  Fry for 6 to 8 minutes or until you have small holes forming and the bottom is crispy brown, then flip and fry for another few minutes on the other side. \nTransfer to a plate and keep warm in a 150 oven while you finish the rest of the pancakes  you should finish with 4 to 6 pancakes.To serve, scatter a portion of the vegetables, herbs and mushrooms over one half of the pancake. \nSprinkle some sauce over top and fold the pancake. \nDrizzle with more sauce and there you go.",

    stepByStep:
      "Preheat oven to 450F. \nSpray a cookie sheet with nonstick spray. \nToss butternut squash with about 1 tbsp olive oil (possibly less, just enough to coat) and season with salt and pepper. \nSpread in one layer on cookie sheet. \nRoast butternut squash for 20-25 minutes, until fork tender. \nWhile squash is roasting, combine quinoa and water or stock in a saucepan. If using water, season with 1/2 tsp salt. Bring to a boil, lower heat, cover and simmer for 10-15 minutes, until liquid is absorbed. \nIn a large bowl, combine cooked quinoa, butternut squash, arugula, 1 tbsp olive oil, balsamic vinegar and crumbled goat cheese. Season with a pinch more salt and pepper. Toss well to mix everything and wilt arugula. \nServe immediately, garnished with toasted nuts, if desired.",
